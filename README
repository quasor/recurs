NOTE: The RiCal library provides a really good implementation of rrule (RecurrenceRules): http://rubydoc.info/gems/ri_cal/0.8.7/RiCal/PropertyValue/RecurrenceRule
but it doesn't seem to support exrules, rdates, or exdates.

#  Recurs
Is a small Recurring Event parsing library. It will take symbolized input and output icalendar standard recurring events,
see the specs for examples of the api

This gem has been tested as a standalone in ruby 1.9, or using Rails 3

It also allows the developer to specifiy specialized Recurrence schemes by using Ruby closures

##  Rails (ActiveRecord)

    class Event < AR
        acts_as_recurring
    end


## TODO
  Finish the instance functionality
